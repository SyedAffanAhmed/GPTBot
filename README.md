# GPTBot
This code assumes that you have already signed up for the OpenAI GPT-3 API and obtained an API key. Replace 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY' in the code with your actual API key.
For simplicity, I've used a simple in-memory data structure within the ChatGPTBotAPI class to store the prompts. In a production scenario, you might want to use a more 
robust data storage method (e.g., a database) for persistence.
The Flask app provides three endpoints for CRUD operations: /create_prompt (POST), /get_response (GET), and /update_prompt (PUT).
The /create_prompt endpoint expects a JSON request with a prompt field containing the user-provided prompt to be stored.
The /get_response endpoint expects a query parameter prompt_index containing the index of the stored prompt for which you want to get the response.
The /update_prompt endpoint expects a JSON request with prompt_index and new_prompt fields. The prompt_index indicates the index of the prompt to update, 
and new_prompt contains the new prompt to replace the existing one.
The Flask app runs in debug mode (debug=True), which helps during development, but it should be disabled in production.
